[Gmail Unsubscribe](https://www.labnol.org/internet/gmail-unsubscribe/28806/) is an open source [Google Script](https://ctrlq.org/code/19959-gmail-unsubscribe) to easily unsubscribe yourself from newsletters and bulks emails in Gmail.

Unroll.me, a free online web app, also lets you 
unsubscribe from junk emails in Gmail with one click. This Google Script is open source and, unlike Unroll.me, it neither collects any of your email messages nor does it sell your data to Uber.
